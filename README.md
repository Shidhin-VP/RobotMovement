# RobotMovement

The [Case Study](https://github.com/Shidhin-VP/RobotMovement/blob/main/Case%20Study.pdf) has been submitted here. 
For [Coding Part](https://github.com/Shidhin-VP/RobotMovement/tree/main/src_codes) I have created 3 phases, which will be explained in detail on each phases, and trying to improve the project technology as it goes. 

## Prerequisite
1. If on Windows:
     * [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
     * [Youtube Video For Reference](https://youtu.be/J8cy6MDkacI?si=eKwv9IsTl3qaiUNJ)
2. ROS2
   * Version: [Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html)
3. If needed to run Virtual Mobile Applications, things that are needed:
   * [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
   * [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
   * [Visual Studio C/C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/)

## Things to Consider. 
1. Using **WSL** or **Native Linux** would be good as the program is built and prefers that.
2. If it's possible, try not to use **Virtual Box**, as it is not programmed to connect to Mobile App via Websocket.
