# RobotMovement

The [Case Study](https://github.com/Shidhin-VP/RobotMovement/blob/main/Case%20Study.pdf) has been submitted here. 
For [Coding Part](https://github.com/Shidhin-VP/RobotMovement/tree/main/src_codes) I have created 3 phases, which will be explained in detail on each phases, and trying to improve the project technology as it goes. 

## Things to Consider. 
1. Using **WSL** or **Native Linux** would be good as the program is built and prefers that.
2. If it's possible, try not to use **Virtual Box**, as it is not programmed to connect to Mobile App via Websocket.


## Short Description about the Phases
1. **Phase1:** Publish commands and Subscriber will acknowledge the commands on the console.
2. **Phase2:** Publishes commands Via a Mobile App through Websockts and Subscriber acknowledges the received command on the terminal.
3. **Phase3:** A mobile app acts as a **Client** and a **Server** receives the command, acknowledge by sending the ack back to client.
